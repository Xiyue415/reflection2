### What is LGBTQ+（YINING WANG)
(From Wikipedia)

LGBTQ+ is an acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender, a term that was coined and popularised in the 1990s when the term "gay community" failed to encompass the full range of related groups. In the 1990s, the term "LGBT" was created and popularised because the term "gay community" did not fully capture the groups involved。In modern parlance, the term "LGBT" is used to refer to all non-heterosexual people, in addition to the narrowly defined gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender community. Alternatively, the letter "Q" has been added to the end of the word to represent Queer and/or questioning people about their gender identity, i.e. LGBTQ. LGBT people have gained a lot of popularity today. LGBT has now been recognised and adopted by most LGBT communities and LGBT media in many English-speaking countries.
### What are LGBTQ+ needs?(LEI PENG)
Mental health and emotional support: LGBTQ+ individuals face higher mental health risks, including depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. The provision of dedicated mental health services and emotional support is essential. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides LGBTQ+ youth resources that emphasize providing safe and supportive environments to reduce the risk of mental health issues.

Anti-discrimination and Equal rights: LGBTQ+ people face discrimination and unequal treatment in multiple areas, including education, employment, health care, and legal identification. Promoting legal and policy changes to ensure equal rights is an important need.

Education and awareness: To increase public understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community and reduce prejudice and discrimination through education. NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Health) provides resources designed to educate and empower LGBTQ+ people, including depression education programs.

Health care access and professionalism: Ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals have access to non-discriminatory and culturally sensitive health care services, especially sexual and reproductive health services.

Social and community support: Building supportive communities and networks is critical to the emotional well-being and social belonging of LGBTQ+ individuals. The LGBT National Help Center offers a variety of services, including hotlines and online support.

Family and relationship recognition: Legal and social recognition of LGBTQ+ families and relationships, including same-sex marriage, adoption rights, and family building support.

Safety and Violence prevention: LGBTQ+ people face a higher risk of physical and sexual violence, and providing protective measures and anti-violence resources is an urgent need.

Here are some specific examples and literature:

1.This article was written by Susan D. Cochran, Vickie M. Mays, Margarita Alegria, Alexander N. Ortega and David Takeuchi. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, volume 75, 2007. This hints at the needs of the LGBTQ+ community with regard to mental health and substance use, especially in the face of multiple sources of discrimination, such as sexual orientation and racial/ethnic identity. The paper highlights the importance of considering these specific risks in mental health service delivery, policy development and community support, as well as the need for further research into how these risks intersect with broader social structures of discrimination and inequality. (Psychological and material needs)

2.Taken together, this study highlights the importance of providing comprehensive social support networks for LGBTQ+ youth and young adults. They need the Internet to talk about their needs and troubles. Their needs also include acceptance and support from family, friends and the community to promote positive adjustment and mental health. These findings have direct implications for the development and implementation of interventions and policies aimed at supporting LGBTQ+ populations. LGBTQ+ people need a lot of support, not only from family, but also from friends, the community, and the wider environment. They tend to be sensitive at heart and need support and affirmation to shore up their mental health.

 3.It's about their ability to raise their children and the impact that has on their well-being. Here are some key points that reflect the needs of LGBTQ+ people and their families:

 ·Family composition: An estimated 2 to 3.7 million U.S. children under the age of 18 have an LGBT parent, and about 200,000 children are being raised by same-sex couples. These numbers underscore the importance of providing support and resources for LGBTQ+ families.

 ·The impact of parents' gender composition on children's well-being: Research shows that same-sex couples make as good parents as opposite-sex couples. The difference in children's well-being in same-sex and opposite-sex families is not due to the gender composition of parents, but rather because children in same-sex families experience more family instability on average.

 ·Changes in social acceptance: As society has become more accepting of LGBT individuals and families, more LGBT people are coming out at younger ages, resulting in fewer same-sex couples having children today than in 2000. It also means that same-sex couples today are more likely to become parents through adoption or reproductive technology, and their children are more likely to be born into stable same-sex families.

 ·Legal recognition and family stability: With same-sex marriage gaining legal recognition in the United States, the situation for same-sex couples to marry and start families is changing rapidly. This opens up new research opportunities to examine how same-sex marriage and parent-child relationships affect children's well-being.

 ·Economic and educational disparities: While LGBT parents and same-sex couples generally have higher levels of education, families with same-sex couples raising children face economic challenges, including lower incomes and higher poverty rates. This highlights the need to provide these families with financial support and resources.

 ·The role of social science research: In legal and political debates, social scientists are being asked to provide evidence to assess the fitness of same-sex couples as parents. Studies consistently show that same-sex parents do not differ in raising their children compared to opposite-sex parents.
The article highlights the importance of providing support for LGBTQ+ families, promoting family stability, and addressing economic challenges, while also demonstrating the profound impact of social acceptance and legal recognition on the way LGBTQ+ individuals and families are formed.

### Why Become LGBTQ+ (Growth Environment)  (XIYUE LYU)
1) Herd mentality: There is also a theory that LGBTQ+ has slowly shifted from a biological definition to a cultural one, as a new kind of pop culture that subtly influences what people say, do and think. There is no shortage of unscrupulous media outlets promoting LGBTQ+ as a "trend" or "cool behaviour", leading or influencing adolescent students to develop false gender perceptions.

2) Genetic factors: a recent study suggests that homosexuality is linked to the X chromosome and is therefore genetic, i.e. inherent, and not selected for; if one twin is an LGBTQ member, then the other twin is likely to be LGBTQ as well.

3) Social Factors: some studies have shown that in some cases poverty and social injustice may increase a person's risk of being LGBT. This can be linked to social stress, mental health issues, and lack of family and community support.

4) Growing up environment:

a. Influence of wealthy, highly educated families on the formation of LGBTQ: Wealthy families tend to have more resources and opportunities to provide better support and environment, including emotional support, psychological support and educational support. This family support can help LGBTQ individuals better accept their sexual orientation and gender identity, and thus express and identify themselves more easily. Their focus on education and their parents' more open and tolerant attitude towards gender and sexual orientation issues allow them to dare to recognise or join LGBTQ.

b. Influence of poverty, lower social class on the formation of LGBTQ: The oppression of real life may make them rebellious. LGBTQ individuals in poor or oppressed class are more vulnerable to rejection and discrimination from family, community and society. This discrimination may lead to confusion and unrest within the individual, affecting their doubt and acceptance of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Mental health problems resulting from poverty or oppressed class, such as anxiety, depression and suicide, may also further affect the formation and expression of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Additionally, poverty or oppressed class may limit an individual's access to education and information. Lack of relevant knowledge and information may make it more difficult for LGBTQ individuals to understand their sexual orientation or gender identity, and may lead to misconceptions and negative perceptions of themselves.

c. Influence of people around them: The surrounding environment also has an influence on LGBTQ people, and their perceptions and values may subconsciously affect those around them; some of the family members, friends and neighbours of the LGBTQ community may also be LGBTQ.

### The size and base of the LGBTQ+ community (JIAWEN YOU)
The data suggests that the LGBTQ+ population is a fairly large and diverse group in the United States. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, approximately 8% of survey participants self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender when asked about their identity, and an additional 2% identified as a sexual orientation other than lesbian, gay, bisexual, or straight, which could include other orientations. The report estimates that more than 2 million people identify as transgender, with bisexual people constituting the largest single demographic group at about 4%. California and Texas are the states with the largest number of LGBTQ+ adult residents, with an estimated 2.6 million and 1.7 million, respectively (Powell, 2021).

According to the Williams Institute, approximately 5.5% of American adults self-identify as LGBTQ+, with an estimated nearly 13.9 million adults belonging to this group.The regional distribution of the LGBTQ+ adult population reveals that the Southern region is home to the largest number of LGBTQ+ adults, accounting for 36% of the total LGBTQ+ population, or approximately 5 million. Washington DC has the highest percentage of LGBTQ+ adults in its adult population at 14.3% (thisisloyal.com, 2020).

### Socioeconomic statistics such as suicide rates, poverty rates, etc. for the LGBTQ+ community (JIAWEN YOU)
It is important to consider that these data are influenced by a number of factors, including social acceptance, discrimination and the availability of support for the LGBTQ+ community. Whilst specific suicide and deprivation rate data was not captured in detail in this search, a wide range of studies and reports point to the fact that the LGBTQ+ community face higher mental health risks than the non-LGBTQ+ community, including a higher risk of suicide, in large part due to the social discrimination, exclusion and bullying faced. For example, Gallup's data shows that 54.6 per cent of LGBTQ+ adults identify as bisexual, and a higher proportion of younger generations (particularly Generation Z) identify as LGBTQ+, suggesting that the number of people who self-identify as LGBTQ+ is likely to continue to increase over time, which also means that the need for support and resources for LGBTQ+ groups will continue to grow (Jones , 2021).

These statistics highlight the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community and the specific challenges they face, as well as the importance of collecting this data to understand and support this community.

### Popular Perceptions of the LGBTQ Community (YINING WANG)
Cultural differences: acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community varies significantly across cultures. Some more diverse and liberal societies are more tolerant and accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, while some conservative cultures and societies may have a negative view of it.

Religious influences: Religious beliefs have a significant impact on the attitudes of individuals and social groups. Certain religious teachings may disapprove of LGBTQ+ lifestyles, which may lead to discrimination or non-acceptance of LGBTQ+ people in religious communities.

Legal and political perspectives

Legal protection: some countries and regions have passed laws to protect LGBTQ+ rights, such as legalising same-sex marriage, anti-discrimination laws, etc....
Social factors: Acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community is increasing over time, especially among younger generations. Education, positive media presentations, and increased visibility of the LGBTQ+ community have all contributed to increased acceptance among the general public.

Economic factors: the level of economic development and individual economic status may also influence perceptions of the LGBTQ+ community. Some studies have shown that acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community tends to be higher in areas that are more economically developed and where individuals are better off financially.

Individual experience and educational perspectives

Level of education: individuals with higher levels of education typically hold more open and inclusive attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. Education not only provides a wider range of knowledge, but also promotes the development of critical thinking skills, which helps people understand and accept diversity.

### Relationships between the LGBTQ community and family members (YINING WANG)
LGBTQ+ community identity is often influenced by beliefs, family structure, culture, and other perceptions

Data survey: report shows: family warmth is positively correlated with lgbtq youth's self-esteem (Meanley et al., 2021)

"Young people expressed confusion and anxiety about the uncertainty of when they would return to school. Of particular concern is the loss of extracurricular activities (e.g., theatre, graduation). Not surprisingly, LGBTQ youth expressed concern about "staying home with unsupportive parents," some of whom are "super religious and homophobic." Many grieved the loss of "safe spaces." Those who could only disclose their LGBTQ identity at school lost contact with friends, Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSAs) and support workers; resulting in nowhere to express themselves. Alternatively, some young people described the freedom to "temporarily escape transphobia and homophobia in real life." (Fish et al., 2020)

### Understanding of the PROJECT and what needs to be accomplished subsequently:
1. a deeper understanding of LGBTQ+ people, which requires reading a lot of literature as well as materials
   
2. What is feasible and what is not for the website design idea.
   
3. Understand the LGBTQ+ community that already exists, and suggest areas of improvement for the website or community, and what strengths we can learn from.
   
4.About how to protect users' identifying information and access thresholds for websites?
